# Railway Configuration
# This file defines how Railway should deploy your services

# Note: Railway v2 doesn't fully support railway.toml for multi-service setup
# You need to configure services manually in Railway UI:
# 
# For API and Bot services:
#   - Root Directory: /backend
#   - Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile
#
# For Frontend service:
#   - Root Directory: /frontend
#   - Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile
